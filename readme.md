# mern stack ecommerce website for a shop

first i created a react app
and initialized git for staging and commiting changes into github repository
then i created a javascript file for storing data of products in an array inside a object
now two components one for showing all products then one for showing a particular product in detail
now created a web server using expresss amd a backend api
now to get data from backend i used axios and used state and effect hook to get data from backend to frontend
used use state hook to manage complex state so to do that we replace state hook with reducer hook
